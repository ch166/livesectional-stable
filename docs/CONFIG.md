# Configuration Management in livesectional

The original design allows for multiple different hardware configurations, airport usage heatmaps, neighboring livesectional devices, LED assignments etc.

Configuration management for these should be predictable

## Airports: airport data file
This is a mapping of LED positions to purpose, where the purpose is either
- Airport ICAO code
- Used for Map LEGEND ( LGND )
- Turned off ( NULL )

Associating an purpose with an LED is positional
- first line in file goes to LED0
- second line in file goes to LED1 etc.

This data set is strongly coupled with the LED configuration and physical layout. It's likely to be defined once for a specific map build, and is then unlikely to change again.

Might be helpful to have a 'lock', 'unlock' configuration management flag - to prevent inadvertent changing of this data once set. Perhaps the airport listing UI initiates in a read-only mode, with an explicit action to go RW

## Hardware configuration data
Hardware Configuration data is likely to be build specific and unlikely to change over time.

### Hardware configuration includes
- LED Data
 - LED strings size
 - LED type RGB / GRB
- OLED Devices Available
- Switches Available
- Light Sensor

### Connectivity
Manage connectivity information
There are two set of problems in this space
- Initial local configuration setup to get onto a network
- Specific network local setup configuration

This space has a bootstrap problem for initial setup - which might need it's own specific solution
There is also the 'how to reset the networking to some defaults'. 
In the scenario where someone is hand building the image for the Raspberry PI, it's probably reasonable to assume they can take care of network configuration,
For the non-technical end user - the configuration management for the raspberry pi probably shouldn't be baked into this system.
Should the base image for this include webmin to take care of general raspberry pi administration 
 - users
 - partitions
 - packages
 - network configuration

### External Data Sources
There are a number of external data sources used for map, airport and weather data.

For external data sources ; do we need to configure a web proxy option ?

For each data source we need
- Source details (URL)
- Source update frequency
- Should we cache the data and possibly use stale versions ?
 - Should cached data be persistent ?

### Display Configuration
Color Sets
 - Master Color Mode
  - Day / Night
  - Bright / Dimmed
  - Light Mode / Dark Mode -- perhaps
 - Wx Conditions - VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR
 - Wx Details
  - Lightning
  - Snow
  - Rain
  - Freezing Rain
  - Dust/Ash
  - Fog
  - Missing Data
Timing Data
 - Daily Schedule


## Device Reset
We need some mechanisms to reset the configuration to some set of defaults
- Hardware setup is unlikely to change between resets
- Log files that contain local user data should be purged

## Operating System upgrades
Full OS upgrades seem to be outside the scope of any of this
Critical security patching may be taken care of at the OS package management level
